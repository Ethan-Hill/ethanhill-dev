          Here I had studied Design and Technology with systems where I had
          studied the creation and programming circuit boards and creating a
          speaker with 3.5mm audio jack and working lights all synced.

          I originally looked into studying Cyber Secuirty but at the last
          minute I changed to Software Engineering and Development which I have
          never regreted.
          <br />
          <br />
          Near the end of my time here I studied some simple usage of HTML, CSS
          and some JS for some cool animations which got me hooked to Web
          development.
