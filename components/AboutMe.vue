          <p class="text-textLight text-xl">
            As a Product UI/UX designer with 5 years of experience, I specialize
            in creating user-centered designs that are both visually appealing
            and easy to use. I have a proven track record of success in
            designing for a variety of industries, including international
            banks, digital crypto wallet apps, payment gateway systems for DAOs,
            and investment platforms.

          <p class="text-textLight text-xl">
            My expertise includes user research, wireframing, prototyping, and
            visual design. I am proficient in using design tools such as Sketch,
            Adobe XD, and Figma, and I have a strong understanding of web and
            mobile design best practices.
