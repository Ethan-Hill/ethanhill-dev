          <p class="text-textLight text-xl">
            I'm Ethan Hill. I'm a passionate Frontend Developer. I'm currently
            19 and I started my programming journey in 2017 when I was
            introduced to HTML. Since then I have been working on my career in
            Software Engineering or Web Development.

          <p class="text-textLight text-xl">
            I have spent a lot of my spare time creating projects to help myself
            learn new aspects of different programming languages and design
            methodologies. I've been studying software engineering and web
            development since 2019 and it has been brilliant.
